Short Bio
======
Huan Wang (Chinese 王欢) is a second-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing and Information Technology at the University of Wollongong, advised by Prof. [Jun Shen](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/jun-shen) and Prof. [Jun Yan](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/jun-yan). 
Previously, I received my master at Xidian University in 2023, advised by Prof. [Lijuan Wang](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/ljwang/index.html).

My research focuses on Federated Learning and Visual Anomaly Detection.

(**Recent News**): Recently, I will soon be going to Singapore Management University (SMU) for a 12-month full-time research visit, advised by Prof. [Guansong Pang](https://sites.google.com/site/gspangsite).
